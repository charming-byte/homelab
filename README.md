👋 Welcome to my Home Operations repository. This monorepo contains my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster configuration. It follows Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps principles, leveraging tools such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

### 🤝 Thanks

Thanks to everyone who contributes their time and expertise to the [Home Operations](https://discord.gg/home-operations) Discord community. Much of the inspiration for my cluster comes from community members who have shared their setups under the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. For additional inspiration and practical deployment examples, the [Kubesearch](http://kubesearch.dev) tool is well worth exploring.
